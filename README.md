This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

A live version of this website can be found here: https://radialbracket.herokuapp.com/

A Website that allows users to create radial brackets to show off their predictions. Users can customize their bracket
By choosing different colours for each team as well as change the fonts, font style, and background. After submitting
their backet, users can download a png file of their bracket. Users can also see how the other users voted and how many
agreed with their picks.

Redux is used to maintain radial bracket state between tabs.
Firebase is used as the database.
D3 functions were used to help React create the svg.
